excerpt: Some useful chrome extensions
---

I have been using Chrome for most of my internet browsing, and here I am sharing the list of the most useful extensions.

1.  [AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog): this is the most useful tool to keep the browser clean from flashing ads. It speed up loading time and removes the eye-sore distractions. Unfortunately, nowadays many sites can detect that you are using the blocker and will not allow you viewing the contents unless you pause it. Sigh..
2.  [Google Dictionary](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-dictionary-by-goog/mgijmajocgfcbeboacabfgobmjgjcoja?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog): this is useful if you are surfing foreign websites, or something alien to you. Just double click the text and google will tell you what is means (likely). Besides, it automatically checks the clipboard when you click the icon.
3.  [HTTPS Everywhere](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/https-everywhere/gcbommkclmclpchllfjekcdonpmejbdp?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog): it automatically switches from insecure “http” to secure “https”. It will protect you against many forms of hijackings, which is vitally important nowadays.
4.  [Save to Pocket](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/save-to-pocket/niloccemoadcdkdjlinkgdfekeahmflj?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog): this is a one click send-to-read-later-offline. Ideal for me given that there is no/poor internet connection during my daily commute.
